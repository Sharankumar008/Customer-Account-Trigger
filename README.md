# Customer-Account-Trigger

Create the object called “Customer” and create the Master-Detail Relationship on Customer object so that Customer will be the related list to the Account record. Create the field called “Account Manager” on the Customer object which is a lookup to the user object.

When we create a Customer record for an account record, then the user in the Account Manager field will be automatically added to the Account Team of that associated account.
